# Breakout-game-Using-OpenGL-in-C-
The project has been implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 which uses C and/or C++ as the language tool. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the BRICKS that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks get broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that in the game moves based on user input from keyboard or mouse. The player moves a PADDLE from side-to-side to hit the BALL. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen. But, if the ball hits the bottom enclosure, the player loses and the game ends! To win the game, the player has to eliminate all the BRICKS in the respective levels. There is a score for a player which is the number of bricks the player was able to destroy before the ball hit the base.

## Gameplay Instructions
In order to play the game, press “S” to launch the ball. After pressing the S key to launch the ball, the ball will be moving.
The players can control the paddle movement in two different ways. It can be controlled by the keyboard as well as the mouse. The player uses the “A” and “D” keys
to move the paddle to the left and to the right respectively. 
For mouse controls the player's movement of the mouse pointer on screen determines the movement of the paddle accordingly.
During the game, if at any time the player wishes to start a new game, he could press the “Q” key.
The goal of the game is to break all of the bricks by intercepting the ball with the paddle and redirecting the ball to collide with the bricks.

## Menu
Players are allowed to change and customize game settings and difficulty using the menu. 
When the player right clicks the mouse,a menu appears which is quite self descriptive. Players can change the colour of the ball, bricks, paddle and text. There is an option to choose the difficulty level namely “Easy”, “Medium” and “Hard”. 
Level ‘Easy’ refers to normal speed and as the level increases to ‘Hard’, the speed increases. Also, the game difficulty can be increased by changing the paddle size from small, medium to large.
Default is “Easy” difficulty level and “Medium” size of paddle.
The major milestones for the project implementation were:
● Displaying the bricks and disappearing after hitting the ball.
● Creating Small platform/paddle which moves left and right given user input from mouse
or keyboard buttons ‘a’ and ‘d’.
● The ball must deflect back after hitting brick, side walls and paddle at the bottom.
● Changing the game difficulty by changing the speed of the ball as well as the paddle
size for different levels.
