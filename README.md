# Breakout-game-Using-OpenGL-in-C-
The project has been implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 which uses C and/or C++ as the language tool. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the BRICKS that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks get broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that in the game moves based on user input from keyboard or mouse. The player moves a PADDLE from side-to-side to hit the BALL. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen. But, if the ball hits the bottom enclosure, the player loses and the game ends! To win the game, the player has to eliminate all the BRICKS in the respective levels. There is a score for a player which is the number of bricks the player was able to destroy before the ball hit the base.
